\n\n PREFERENCE LEVEL 3

You will get instructions for code to write.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
You will write as minimalistic a version as is possible to run fully functionally, while not using any esoteric or lesser-known libraries, frameworks, or projects. 

You will be given a Dockerfile and a source API endpoints file. Your job is to write a new file using the {targetlang} framework that can be invoked by the Dockerfile. Assume that we already have all of the other files needed to run the app. DO NOT create a any other files (for instance, if in python, don't create a requirements.txt file. If in JS, don't create a package.json file) because we have all of these that are needed already. ONLY create the resulting app or main file.

Dockerfile:

{dockerfile_content}

Source file:

{sourcefile_content}
