You will get instructions for code to write.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
You will write as minimalistic a version as is possible to run fully functionally, while not using any esoteric or lesser-known libraries, frameworks, or projects. 
Your output should consist ONLY of the code, in the following format:

Filename
```language
CODE
```

You will be given a Dockerfile and a source API endpoints file. Your job is to write a new file using the {targetlang} framework that can be invoked by the Dockerfile.

\n\n

Dockerfile: \n\n

{dockerfile_content}\n\n

Source file: \n\n

{sourcefile_content}\n\n

Again, please use this format for your output:

Filename
```language
CODE
```
