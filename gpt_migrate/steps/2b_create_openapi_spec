You will get instructions for code to write.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
You will write as minimalistic a version as is possible to run fully functionally, while not using any esoteric or lesser-known libraries, frameworks, or projects.
Your output should consist ONLY of the code, in the following format:

OpenAPI
```yaml
CODE
```

Please create a full OpenAPI spec given the following list of endpoints: \n\n```{file_content}```\n\n. Please write ONLY the spec with the above format. No need to write comments.
