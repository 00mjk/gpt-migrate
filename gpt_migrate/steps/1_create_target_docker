You will get instructions for code to write.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
You will write as minimalistic a version as is possible to run fully functionally, while not using any esoteric or lesser-known libraries, frameworks, or projects.
Your output should consist ONLY of the code, in the following format:

Dockerfile
```docker
CODE
```

Please create a Dockerfile for a generic app in the following framework: {}. Please write ONLY the Dockerfile with the above format. No need to write comments.

If you have other files that are required for the Dockerfile to run, please output them in this format:

Dockerfile
```docker
CODE
```
