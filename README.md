# GPT-Migrate

## Easily migrate your code from one framework or language to another.

If you've ever faced the pain of migrating a codebase to a new framework or language, this project is for you. 

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. Migration is a costly, tedious, and non-trivial problem. Do not trust the current version blindly and please use responsibly.

However, with the collective brilliance of our community and the current state of LLMs, it is also a very tractable problem.

Usage:

Install Docker and ensure that it's running. It's also recommended that you use at least GPT-4, preferably GPT-4-32k.

- `cd gpt_migrate && source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py --targetlang nodejs`

## Help wanted
We're looking for more core contributors. Whether you have a particular passion about a specific language or framework, want to us in creating a more robust test suite, or generally have interesting ideas on how to make this better, we'd love to have you!
