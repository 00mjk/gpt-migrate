# GPT-Migrate

## Easily migrate your code from one framework or language to another.

If you've ever faced the pain of migrating a codebase to a new framework or language, this project is for you. 

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. Migration is a costly, tedious, and non-trivial problem. Do not trust the current version blindly and please use responsibly.

However, with the collective brilliance of our community and the current state of LLMs, it is also a very tractable problem.

Usage:

Install Docker and ensure that it's running. It's also recommended that you use at least GPT-4, preferably GPT-4-32k.

`export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python main.py --targetlang nodejs`
